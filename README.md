# TypeScript OOP
Creating Object-oriented TypeScript Code

# Object and the Real World
-   Bank
-   Bike
-   Taco

# The Role of Objects
-   Object

# Key Object Creation Techniques
-   Constructor
-   Object.create()
-   Object Literal
-   Class

# Principles of Object-Oriented Programming
-   Abstraction
-   Encapsulation
-   Inheritance
-   Polymorphism

# Understanding the Role of Classes
-   Blueprint(Class)
-   Building(Object)
```
class Person {
    constructor(public firstName: string, public lastName: string) { }
}
```
# Automatic Properties
-   Properties can be defined in a constructor using accessibility modifiers(public/private)
-   By using automatic property functionality, a property will be generated, and the constructor value will be mapped to it

# Understanding the Role of Inheritance
-   Automobile (make, model, price)
-   Car
-   Truck

# Abstract Classes
-   BankAccount(abstract class)
-   CheckingAccount
-   SavingsAccount

# Implementing an Interface
-   Interface(deposit(), withdrawal())
-   BankAccount(deposite(), withdrawal())
-   ATM (deposit(), withdrawal())
-   CheckingAccount(BankAcount[deposite()] [withdrawal()]) [deposite()] [withdrawal()]
-   SavingsAccount(BankAcount[deposite()] [withdrawal()]) [deposite()] [withdrawal()]
